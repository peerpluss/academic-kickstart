## CCC简介

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a fun challenge for secondary school students with an interest in programming. It is an opportunity for students to test their ability in designing, understanding and implementing algorithms.
## Peerplus经验

Edison ： 含金量一般，题目比较少但是难度递增很大，学习计算机科学类专业的同学们推荐参加。有junior和senior两个组，junior得奖很容易。
